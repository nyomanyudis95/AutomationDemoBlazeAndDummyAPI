# AutomationDemoBlazeAndDummyAPI

These are several point that i think it can be improved in DemoBlaze : 
1. There is no active page in header navigation. So for new user doesn't know which page they are now. 
2. Contact Modal doesn't have validation from every input.
3. Place Order Modal only has restriction name and credit card. 
4. Place Order Modal and Success Order Modal is show at same time, it should be show one by one.  

These are several point that i have hard time to make this automation : 
1. In header navigation between Cart Page and Home Page, button Cart navigation has different id. It's a prove that each page dont use reusable component. 

These are several point that i can't automate test in demoblaze: 
1. Can't test sign up success. It's because demoblaze dont give priviledge to delete account that used for sign up.
2. Can't test category product. Because there are no information to know which category from one product 
3. Can't test url video about us. Because url video always change every time.
